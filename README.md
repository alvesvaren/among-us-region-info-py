# Among Us regionInfo.dat creator

This is a simple python script to generate the regionInfo file needed for among us custom servers.

## Basic usage:
```sh
python main.py "Server name" 127.0.0.1
```
This will generate a file called regionInfo.dat in your current folder, which could then be placed at:
`C:\Users\username\AppData\LocalLow\Innersloth\Among Us\regionInfo.dat`

This could for example be used to create a custom name for the server when using the [Impostor server](https://github.com/AeonLucid/Impostor) for among us
